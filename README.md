# 👋 Hi, I'm Gregory Putman

🔧 **Technical Product Owner & Architect & DevOps Leader** specializing in infrastructure automation, observability, and cloud-native transformation.  
💡 **Former Intel engineer** with deep expertise in VMware, Terraform, Kubernetes, PowerShell, and CI/CD orchestration.  
🚀 Passionate about building resilient, scalable, and secure systems that accelerate innovation — and reduce complexity.

### 🧠 About Me

I design and automate large-scale infrastructure solutions that bridge on-prem data centers and the cloud.  
My background spans **DevOps, virtualization, infrastructure-as-code (IaC)**, and **site reliability engineering (SRE)** — enabling faster delivery, stronger security, and measurable cost savings.

Currently focused on:
- 🌩️ **Hybrid cloud automation** using Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions  
- 🧩 **Kubernetes** for scalable, containerized workloads  
- 🛠️ **Observability & performance optimization** (Prometheus, Grafana, Dynatrace)  
- 🧱 **Infrastructure security & IAM integration**
